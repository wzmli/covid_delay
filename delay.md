# Introduction

Delay is critical in terms of thinking and modeling the spread of infectious disease, especially with data. This term is often loosely used and can be very confusing. For example

Reporting delay means the time it takes to confirm an individual status (usually through collect samples from the individual and get it tested in the lab)

Infection delay means the time it takes an individual to get infected.

Fill me with other delay examples.

There are two types of delays (MLi: we have to use another term, it is too confusing) I want to talk about here, and I think the mechanisms are transferable.  

1. serious-delay: an individual will only do XX if they have to. For example, an infected person will only get tested if they feel sick or meets all the testing criteria 

2. capacity-delay: There is a capacity to do YY, so there is a backlog.

We have seen evidence of both mechanisms in COVID19 in two types of settings. 

## Testing 
1. there was a massive backlog in testing in Ontario (similar in a lot of different places)

2. People cannot get tested even when there are higher capacities due to testing criteria.

Question: how do we account for the backlog? We have all the numbers.

## Treatment
1. limited resources, hospital beds, etc

2. people are scared to get treatment, don't want to go unless it is very serious

Question: How does this relate to the weird patterns we see with the early slowdowns of ICU in Ontario.
